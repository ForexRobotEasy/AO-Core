# AO Core ReadMe

This ReadMe file provides a description and explanation of the code for the AO Core program developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. We are only providing a sample code that can work as described in this product.

## Overview

The AO Core program is designed to execute trading decisions based on market conditions. It includes functions for optimizing profit/risk ratio and portfolio allocation. The program uses the Trade and Random libraries for trading operations and random number generation, respectively.

## Code Explanation

### Libraries

The code includes the following necessary libraries:
- Trade: This library provides functions for trading operations.
- Math\Random: This library is used for generating random numbers.

### Constants

The code defines the following constants:
- INITIAL_BALANCE: The initial account balance for trading.
- PROFIT_TARGET: The target profit percentage.
- RISK_THRESHOLD: The threshold for acceptable risk.

### Trade Object Initialization

The code initializes the trade object using the CTrade class.

### Optimization Functions

The code includes two optimization functions:
1. OptimizeProfitRiskRatio: This function calculates the profit/risk ratio by dividing the profit by the risk.
2. OptimizePortfolio: This function performs portfolio optimization calculations based on the risk, return, and correlation parameters.

### Main Function (OnTick)

The main function, OnTick, is called on every tick of the market. It performs the following actions:
1. Retrieves the current market price.
2. Makes trading decisions based on market conditions. If the current price is positive, a buy trade is executed. If the current price is negative, a sell trade is executed.
3. Checks if the target profit is reached. If the account balance exceeds the initial balance multiplied by (1 + PROFIT_TARGET), all trades are closed, and the program ends.
4. Checks if the risk threshold is exceeded. If the current risk value exceeds the RISK_THRESHOLD, all trades are closed, and the program ends.
5. Calls the optimization functions, passing predefined parameters.

### Program Entry Point (OnInit)

The OnInit function is called when the program is initialized. It sets the initial account balance and initializes the trade object with a deviation of 30 points.

### Program Exit Point (OnDeinit)

The OnDeinit function is called when the program is terminated. It closes all trades before the program exits.
